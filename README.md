Additionally, the website uses Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework that provides a range of pre-built UI components and styles to help make the site more responsive and visually appealing.

The primary goal of the Notex website is to simplify note-taking for users and to provide them with a centralized location to access and manage their notes. Users can sign up for an account, create and categorize their notes, and access them from any device with an internet connection.

Creating new notes: Users can create and save them to their accounts. They can also categorize their notes by subject or topic for easy organization.
Editing notes: Users can edit their existing messages at any time, changing the content, formatting, or layout as needed.

Deleting notes: Users can delete any notes they no longer need, freeing up space in their account for new notes.
